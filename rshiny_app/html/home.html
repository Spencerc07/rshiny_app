        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p> "Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a manualized treatment originally created for treatment of those with Bipolar Personality Disorder (BPD). 
        Traditionally, DBT has a detailed structure which a clinician attempts to follow that covers multiple aspects of therapy from validation to reciprocal communication strategies as proposed by Marsha Linehan. 
        Through following the ideas and principals behind the checklists, a therapist can provide true DBT to their patientâ€™s." </p>

        <p> "The intent of this application is to allow therapists to track their adherence over time and across certain clients. 
        This application also allows for the therapist to view how his peers have rated him in comparison to his own views of his current level of ability."</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>"This application is based off the principles of the Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder written by Marsha Linehan."</p>
